- raw: Storing the raw result which is generated from "preparation" folder code. My practice is storing a local subset copy rather than retrieving data from remote data store from time to time. It guarantees you have a static dataset for rest of action. Furthermore, we can isolate from data platform unstable issue and network latency issue.
- processed: To shorten model training time, it is a good idea to persist processed data. It should be generated from "processing" folder.
